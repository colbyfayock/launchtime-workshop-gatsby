# ðŸ““ Lesson 01: A Little Overview About Maps

The last time you drove out of town, how did you find where to go? That's right, you most likely used a mapping app like Google Maps or Apple Maps, but did you ever think about how those maps were built and whether or not you could build your own?

Mapping apps are an everyday tool we take for granted. They give us a ton of power in the palm of our hand like driving directions or trying to look for the best place to find coffee when we're on vacation.

But there's a lot more to maps than driving directions! Scientists uses maps every day as a research tool to try to analyze patterns and make impactful decisions.

For our first lesson, we're going to briefly walk through how maps work and kick off the workshop by installing the dependencies we'll need to build a map!

## Objectives
